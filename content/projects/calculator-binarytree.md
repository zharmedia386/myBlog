title: Calculator Using Binary Tree
type: page

### Description

This application is a calculator application where the user can input arithmetic expressions into the application which will be calculated scientifically and also displayed on the screen for the result.

This projects used C programming language as a main language for building this project. To accommodate mathematical expressions entered by the user, the developer uses a Binary Tree based on data structure subject. The process of making a tree will utilize the concept of a binary expression tree, so it will be easier later in calculating the results of the expressions that have been entered before.

By using the infix approach, we can reduce the use of the ADT stack which is usually required in the postfix approach.
